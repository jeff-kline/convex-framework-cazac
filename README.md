# Convex refinement for CAZAC feasibility (SOCP) + block-circulant Hadamard construction

This repository is a runnable reference implementation of the method described in the manuscript
*A Convex Programming Framework for Constructing CAZAC Sequences*.

## Main contribution

A practical **convex refinement** procedure: a sequence of **second-order cone programs (SOCPs)** that drives families of complex sequences toward

- **(Approx.) constant modulus** in time (via a convex amplitude bound that is tightened to `τ = 1`), and
- **Coupled spectral flatness** across `N` sequences (via a convex Fourier-energy bound),

with optional **convex side constraints** (e.g., phase-window restrictions). Each refinement step is a **globally optimal convex subproblem**, which is the key algorithmic advantage over alternating-projections baselines.

For `N = 2`, the two refined sequences induce a **block-circulant complex Hadamard matrix** of size `(2n)×(2n)`:
\[
H=\begin{pmatrix}X&Y\\-Y^*&X^*\end{pmatrix},
\]
where `X` and `Y` are circulant matrices generated by the two length-`n` sequences.
